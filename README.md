### Records of Endangered Storm Stork (_Ciconia stormi_) in Mesangat Wetland
[Publication]([https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/8/3048](https://www.academia.edu/95933549/Records_of_the_Endangered_Storms_Stork_Ciconia_stormi_in_East_Kutai_East_Kalimantan_Indonesia_and_notes_on_its_conservation_in_Borneo?uc-g-sw=2646643))

Storm’s Stork (Ciconia stormi) is a critically endangered stork species found in Southeast Asia, particularly in Sumatra and Borneo. With an estimated population of 260-330 individuals, it inhabits lowland forests and wetlands, including Danau Mesangat in East Kalimantan, Indonesia. Despite habitat degradation, recent surveys have documented its presence in Mesangat, emphasizing the wetland's importance for the species. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect and restore these habitats to ensure the survival of Storm’s Stork and other threatened species.

### Prediction of Siamese crocodile potential habitat in Kalimantan Timur unsing Maximum Entropy

Using Maximum Entropy modeling, this study predicts potential habitat for the Siamese crocodile (Crocodylus siamensis) in East Kalimantan, Indonesia. By analyzing environmental variables and species occurrence data, the model identifies suitable areas where the crocodile could thrive. This research aims to guide conservation efforts by highlighting critical habitats that require protection and management to support the species' survival in the region.
